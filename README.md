This is a free, open textbook to introduce students to cognitive psychology.

## About the Book

This open-access textbook introduces the core topics in cognitive psychology for anyone teaching or taking a survey course on the subject. It is designed to be accessible to students from all backgrounds, including those with no prior coursework in psychology. The book covers foundational concepts such as perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, and problem solving, introducing classic research alongside contemporary perspectives.

The textbook represents the work of dozens of authors and collaborators. The first edition aggregated multiple Open Educational Resources, which were then edited into a single book with consistent voice and formatting. For the second edition, a team of graduate student content experts comprehensively reviewed and updated the materials. The current version includes ongoing improvements and revisions.

Celeste Pilegard, Associate Teaching Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego, leads the book project. The full list of authors and contributors appears on the [About](https://pilegard.github.io/cogfoundations/index.html) page.

The book was formatted using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), an R package.
