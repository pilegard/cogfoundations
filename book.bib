               performance without the need for step-by-step attentional

               such proceduralization makes putting vulnerable to decrements
               under pressure. Experiments 3-4 examined choking and the ability
               of training conditions to ameliorate it in putting and a
               nonproceduralized alphabet arithmetic skill analogous to mental

               ear to the other, as assessed by perception of the words of the

               Performance was not disrupted by listening to radio broadcasts
               or listening to a book on tape. Nor was it disrupted by a
               continuous shadowing task using a handheld phone, ruling out, in
               this case, dual-task interpretations associated with holding the
               phone, listening, or speaking, However significant interference
               was observed in a word-generation variant of the shadowing task,
               and this deficit increased with the difficulty of driving.
               Moreover unconstrained conversations using either a handheld or
               a hands-free cell phone resulted in a twofold increase in the
               failure to detect simulated traffic signals and slower reactions

               working memory. Over the years, this has been successful in
               giving an integrated account not only of data from normal
               adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and
               neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena
               that are not readily captured by the original model. These are
               outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic
               buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that
               provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal
               code, which is capable of binding information from the
               subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary
               episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be
               the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised
               model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on
               the processes of integrating information, rather than on the
               isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better

               directed towards the general problem concerning the faculty we
               possess of perceiving only one acoustic world under normal
               conditions (in spite of having two ears) and yet, if our ears be
               stimulated by different signals, artificially, we can attend to
               one or the other of them. The tests have been made with
               continuous speech (readings from light fiction) and the results
               assessed statistically. The first tests aim at measuring the
               reaction time r required to ``switch the attention'' from one
               ear to the other, as assessed by perception of the words of the
               message. A second set of tests show that we perceive only one
               speaker, as a ``gestalt,'' when the ears are stimulated by
               similar messages but with a delay between them exceeding 20

               (``Inhibition'')-and their roles in complex ``frontal lobe'' or
               ``executive'' tasks. One hundred thirty-seven college students
               performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are
               considered to predominantly tap each target executive function
               as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the
               Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random
               number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking.
               Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target
               executive functions are moderately correlated with one another,
               but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation
               modeling suggested that the three functions contribute
               differentially to performance on complex executive tasks.
               Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to
               Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and
               operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not
               related to any of the three target functions. These results

  abstract  = "Attempts to measure advertising effectiveness have relied on
               explicit memory measures based on recall or recognition.
               However, recent cognitive research has shown that not only is it
               possible to measure unconscious effects of prior experience
               through implicit tests of memory, but that such performance is
               independent of explicit recollection. The present study sought
               to determine whether it is possible to demonstrate the same
               pattern of findings using print advertising in an ecologically
               valid situation. Eighty subjects saw 25 full‐page colour
               magazine adverts in either a deliberate or incidental study
               condition and subsequently rated (on four salient dimensions) a
               set of 50 adverts, which included the target adverts. Following
               the ratings subjects were asked to indicate which of the adverts
               they recognized as having been in the original set. While the
               deliberate study group recognized around 60 per cent of the
               adverts, the incidental study group recognized only 11 per cent.
               However, both groups showed the same positive bias in attitudes
               towards the adverts they had been exposed to compared to the
               ones they had not seen before. Thus, in line with by the
               cognitive literature, it is possible to show shifts in attitudes
               that are independent of conscious recollection. This data

               ``filtering'' (Broadbent, 1958). The experiments extend Cherry's
               finding (1953) that Ss noticed if the rejected message was
               identical to the selected one but a few seconds out of step. It
               was shown that (a) the comparison between the messages must be
               made at a central level, and required the identification of
               words and meaning rather than a simple analysis of the sounds,
               since Ss noticed the identity of the messages even when they
               were in different voices or different languages; (b) their
               identity is noticed at a 5-sec interval when a selected message
               of coherent prose leads the rejected one in time, but at 1 or 2

               Treisman's suggestion (1960) that the filter acts by attenuating
               rather than blocking irrelevant signals. The second may give a
               measure of the different storage times for selected and rejected
               material. The critical delay interval for recognition also
               varied with the verbal content of the selected message: it
               decreased both when the information content of the words was
               high, and when the order of the items was crucial to the

               retrieval provides an additional presentation of the target
               item. Two methods of learning paired associates were compared.
               In the pure study trial (pure ST condition) method, both items
               of a pair were presented simultaneously for study. In the test
               trial/study trial (TTST condition) method, subjects attempted to
               retrieve the response term during a period in which only the
               stimulus term was present (and the response term of the pair was
               presented after a 5-sec delay). Final retention of target items
               was tested with cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a
               reliable advantage in final testing for nonsense-syllable/number
               pairs in the TTST condition over pairs in the pure ST condition.
               In Experiment 2, the same result was obtained with
               Eskimo/English word pairs. This benefit of the TTST condition
               was not apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min or
               after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two artifactual
               explanations of the TTST advantage observed in the first two
               experiments. Because performing a memory retrieval (TTST
               condition) led to better performance than pure study (pure ST
               condition), the results reject the hypothesis that a successful

              the syllables decreased across 10 s, confirming that auditory

               rats trained with any of these NMDA antagonists failed to show
               response transfer when tested with saline. Also, in rats trained
               with saline the response failed to transfer in tests with any of
               these drugs. The doses at which the failure to transfer occurred
               in drug-to-saline tests, were approximately 3-fold lower than

               studies have demonstrated that learning-related neural activity
               is re-expressed during posttraining nonrapid eye movement (NREM)
               sleep. NREM sleep processes appear to be particularly beneficial
               for hippocampus-dependent forms of memory. These observations
               suggest that learning triggers the reactivation and
               reorganization of memory traces during sleep, a systems-level
               process that in turn enhances behavioral performance. Here, we
               hypothesized that dreaming about a learning experience during
               NREM sleep would be associated with improved performance on a
               hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task. Subjects were trained

               5 hr after initial training. Improved performance at retest was
               strongly associated with task-related dream imagery during an
               intervening afternoon nap. Task-related thoughts during
               wakefulness, in contrast, did not predict improved performance.
               These observations suggest that sleep-dependent memory
               consolidation in humans is facilitated by the offline
               reactivation of recently formed memories, and furthermore that
               dream experiences reflect this memory processing. That similar

               published in the last decade, yet no quantitative analysis
               exists to evaluate the overall effects. Here we present the
               first meta-analysis of sleep TMR, compiled from 91 experiments
               with 212 effect sizes (N = 2,004). Based on multilevel modeling,
               overall sleep TMR was highly effective (Hedges' g = 0.29, 95\%
               CI [0.21, 0.38]), with a significant effect for two stages of
               non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep (Stage NREM 2: Hedges' g =
               0.32, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.60]; and slow-wave sleep: Hedges' g =
               0.27, 95\% CI [0.20, 0.35]). In contrast, TMR was not effective
               during REM sleep nor during wakefulness in the present analyses.
               Several analysis strategies were used to address the potential
               relevance of publication bias. Additional analyses showed that
               TMR improved memory across multiple domains, including
               declarative memory and skill acquisition. Given that TMR can
               reinforce many types of memory, it could be useful for various
               educational and clinical applications. Overall, the present

               TMR can influence memory storage during NREM sleep, and that
               this method can be useful for understanding neurocognitive

Analyses suggest that ISI and retention interval operate jointly to affect final-test retention; specifically, the ISI producing maximal retention increased as retention interval increased. Areas needing future research and theoretical implications are discussed. Copyright 2006 by the American Psychological Association.},

   abstract = {To achieve enduring retention, people must usually study information on multiple occasions. How does the timing of study events affect retention? Prior research has examined this issue only in a spotty fashion, usually with very short time intervals. In a study aimed at characterizing spacing effects over significant durations, more than 1,350 individuals were taught a set of facts and - after a gap of up to 3.5 months - given a review. A final test was administered at a further delay of up to 1 year. At any given test delay, an increase in the interstudy gap at first increased, and then gradually reduced, final test performance. The optimal gap increased as test delay increased. However, when measured as a proportion of test delay, the optimal gap declined from about 20 to 40% of a 1-week test delay to about 5 to 10% of a 1-year test delay. The interaction of gap and test delay implies that many educational practices are highly inefficient. © Copyright © 2008 Association for Psychological Science.},

We review methodological issues in retrieval practice research, identify key findings to be accounted for, and evaluate current candidate theories. We propose an episodic context account of retrieval-based learning, which explains retrieval practice in terms of context reinstatement, context updating, and restriction of the search set. Retrieval practice involves attempting to reinstate a prior learning context, and when retrieval is successful, the representation of context is updated to include features of retrieved contexts and the current context. Future retrieval is enhanced because updated context representations can be used to restrict the search set and hone in on a desired target. The context account accommodates a wide variety of phenomena in the retrieval practice literature and provides a comprehensive and cohesive account of retrieval-based learning. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Objectives: In addition to the extrinsic effects of assessment and examinations on students' study habits, testing can have an intrinsic effect on the memory of studied material. Whether this testing effect also applies to skills learning is not known. However, this is especially interesting in view of the need to maximise learning outcomes from costly simulation-based courses. This study was conducted to determine whether testing as the final activity in a skills course increases learning outcome compared with an equal amount of time spent practising the skill. Methods: We carried out a prospective, controlled, randomised, single-blind, post-test-only intervention study, preceded by a similar pre- and post-test pilot study in order to make a power calculation. A total of 140 medical students participating in a mandatory 4-hour in-hospital resuscitation course in the seventh semester were randomised to either the intervention or control group and were invited to participate in an assessment of learning outcome. The intervention course included 3.5 hours of instruction and training followed by 30 minutes of testing. The control course included 4 hours of instruction and training. Participant learning outcomes were assessed 2 weeks after the course in a simulated scenario using a checklist. Total assessment scores were compared between the two groups. Results: Overall, 81 of the 140 students volunteered to participate. Learning outcomes were significantly higher in the intervention group (n = 41; mean score 82.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.4-86.2) compared with the control group (n = 40; mean score 73.3%, 95% CI 70.5-76.1) (P < 0.001). Effect size was 0.93. Conclusions: Testing as a final activity in a resuscitation skills course for medical students increases learning outcome compared with spending an equal amount of time practising the skills. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.},

   abstract = {Context: laboratory studies in cognitive psychology with relatively brief final recall intervals suggest that repeated retrieval in the form of tests may result in better retention of information compared with repeated study. Objectives: Our study evaluates if repeated testing of material taught in a real-life educational setting (a didactic conference for paediatric and emergency medicine residents) replicates these findings when measured at a more educationally relevant final recall interval of 6 months. Methods: Residents participated in an interactive teaching session on two topics: (i) status epilepticus, and (ii) myasthenia gravis. Residents were randomised to two counter-balanced groups which either took tests on status epilepticus and studied a review sheet on myasthenia gravis (SE-T/MG-S group) or took tests on myasthenia gravis and studied a review sheet on status epilepticus (MG-T/SE-S group). Testing and studying occurred immediately after teaching and then at two additional times at intervals of about 2 weeks. Residents received feedback after each test. Tests consisted of short-answer questions and the review sheets consisted of information identical to that on the answer sheets for the tests. At about 6 months residents took a final test on both topics. Results: Nineteen residents in the SE-T/MG-S group and 21 residents in the MG-T/SE-S group completed the study. Collapsing across groups, repeated testing produced final test scores that were an average of 13% higher than those produced by repeated study (39% versus 26%) at > 6 months after the initial teaching session (t[78] = 3.93, standard error of the difference = 0.03, P < 0.001, d = 0.91). Conclusions: Repeated testing with feedback appears to result in significantly greater long-term retention of information taught in a didactic conference than repeated, spaced study. Testing should be considered for its potential impact on learning and not only as an assessment device. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.},

   abstract = {Repeating an item in a list benefits recall performance, and this benefit increases when the repetitions are spaced apart (Madigan, 1969; Melton, 1970). Retrieved context theory incorporates two mechanisms that account for these effects: contextual variability and study-phase retrieval. Specifically, if an item presented at position i is repeated at position j, this leads to retrieval of its context from its initial presentation at i (study-phase retrieval) and this retrieved context will be used to update the current state of context (contextual variability). Here we consider predictions of a computational model that embodies retrieved context theory, the context maintenance and retrieval model (CMR; Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009). CMR makes the novel prediction that subjects are more likely to successively recall items that follow a shared repeated item (e.g. i + 1, j + 1) because both items are associated with the context of the repeated item presented at i and j. CMR also predicts that the probability of recalling at least one of two studied items should increase with the items’ spacing (Lohnas, Polyn, & Kahana, 2011). We tested these predictions in a new experiment and CMR’s predictions were upheld. These findings suggest that retrieved context theory offers an integrated explanation for repetition and spacing effects in free recall tasks.},

   abstract = {Laboratory studies show that taking a test on studied material promotes subsequent learning and retention of that material on a final test (termed the testing effect). Educational research has virtually ignored testing as a technique to improve classroom learning. We investigated the testing effect in a college course. Students took weekly quizzes followed by multiple choice criterial tests (unit tests and a cumulative final). Weekly quizzes included multiple choice or short answer questions, after which feedback was provided. As an exposure control, in some weeks students were presented target material for additional reading. Quizzing, but not additional reading, improved performance on the criterial tests relative to material not targeted by quizzes. Further, short answer quizzes produced more robust benefits than multiple choice quizzes. This pattern converges with laboratory findings showing that recall tests are more beneficial than recognition tests for subsequent memory performance. We conclude that in the classroom testing can be used to promote learning, not just to evaluate learning. © 2007 Psychology Press.},

   abstract = {When individuals learn facts (e.g., foreign language vocabulary) over multiple study sessions, the temporal spacing of study has a significant impact on memory retention. Behavioral experiments have shown a nonmonotonic relationship between spacing and retention: short or long intervals between study sessions yield lower cued-recall accuracy than intermediate intervals. Appropriate spacing of study can double retention on educationally relevant time scales. We introduce a Multiscale Context Model (MCM) that is able to predict the influence of a particular study schedule on retention for specific material. MCM's prediction is based on empirical data characterizing forgetting of the material following a single study session. MCM is a synthesis of two existing memory models (Staddon, Chelaru, & Higa, 2002; Raaijmakers, 2003). On the surface, these models are unrelated and incompatible, but we show they share a core feature that allows them to be integrated. MCM can determine study schedules that maximize the durability of learning, and has implications for education and training. MCM can be cast either as a neural network with inputs that fluctuate over time, or as a cascade of leaky integrators. MCM is intriguingly similar to a Bayesian multiscale model of memory (Kording, Tenenbaum, & Shadmehr, 2007), yet MCM is better able to account for human declarative memory.},

   abstract = {We examined testing's ability to enhance adult spelling acquisition, relative to copying and reading. Across 3 experiments in which testing with feedback was compared with copying, the spelling improvement after testing matched that following the same amount of time spent copying. A potent testing advantage, however, was observed for spelling words free-recalled. In the fourth experiment, a large testing advantage for both word free recall and spelling was observed, versus reading. Subjects also generally preferred testing and rated it as more effective than copying or reading. The equivalent performance of testing and copying for spelling contrasts with prior work involving children and suggests that retrieval practice may not be the only effective mechanism for spelling skill acquisition. Rather, we suggest that the critical learning event for spelling is focused study on phoneme-to-grapheme mappings for previously unlearned letter sequences. For adults with extensive spelling expertise, focused study is more automatic during both copying and testing with feedback than for individuals with beginning spelling skills. Reading, however, would not be expected to produce efficient focused study of phonemeto-grapheme mappings, regardless of expertise level. Overall, adult spelling skill acquisition benefits both from testing and copying, and substantially less from reading.},

With no free parameters, that model predicts both proportion correct in the test condition and the magnitude of the testing effect across 10 experiments conducted in our laboratory, experiments that varied with respect to material type, retention interval, and performance in the restudy condition. The model also provides the first quantitative accounts of (a) the testing effect as a function of performance in the restudy condition, (b) the upper bound magnitude of the testing effect, (c) the effect of correct answer feedback, (d) the testing effect as a function of retention interval for the cases of feedback and no feedback, and (e) the effect of prior learning method on subsequent learning through testing.

               experiences as children that are mentioned in the ads. In
               Experiment 1, participants viewed an ad for Disney that
               suggested that they shook hands with Mickey Mouse as a child.

               they personally had shaken hands with Mickey as a child at a
               Disney resort. The increased confidence could be due to a
               revival of a true memory or the creation of a new, false one. In

               Go Wrong,'' published in 2011, tells the story of the first 250
               DNA exonerations in the United States. There have now been 330
               DNA exonerations. There is no other country in the world in
               which such a large group of people have been exonerated by DNA
               evidence. This Chapter updates data collected when researching
               the book, and in many respects, the patterns remain the same.
               Many faced quite severe sentences. Twenty exonerees had been
               sentenced to death. Ninety-two were sentenced to life in prison,
               12 of which were sentenced to life without parole. The vast
               majority, 80 percent of these DNA exonerees, were racial
               minorities. There have been some notable changes in the
               composition of the most recent set of DNA exonerations. The more
               recent DNA exonerations include far more murder convictions than
               the first 250 DNA exonerations. These changes have impacted the
               types of evidence prominent in the cases. Similarly high
               percentages of cases involve eyewitness misidentifications
               (70\%) and forensics (69\%). Most striking, more of the cases
               include false confessions (21\%) and informant testimony (22\%).
               Many of the most recent exonerations were particularly hard
               fought along the path to eventual exoneration. Often because
               prosecutors were swayed by confession evidence they continued to
               litigated cases for years, even despite DNA tests results.
               Indeed, 22 of the recent 80 cases involved DNA analysis, 18 of
               which DNA exclusions of individuals that were nevertheless
               convicted; 3 more of which involved DNA exclusions concealed
               from the defense, and one more case, which involved a sample
               mix-up leading to an error in DNA analysis. Of the 227 cases
               that involved forensic evidence, 46\% or 105 cases, involved
               invalid, erroneous, or concealed forensics. Almost half of the
               cases with eyewitness identifications involved cross-racial
               identifications. Twenty-nine of these inmates received vacaturs
               during appeals or post-conviction occurring prior to their DNA
               exonerations, representing 14\% of the 204 that had written
               decisions published by judges. These most recent exonerations
               are particularly troubling, because some of the same underlying
               practices that can lead to wrongful convictions are with us
               today, even if reforms are spreading and attitudes towards
               criminal justice are shifting.",

               retrieval attempts. In the first interview, they were asked
               about one real and one false event, both introduced as true
               according to their parents. In two subsequent interviews, they
               were reinterviewed about the false event. Finally, after the
               third inquiry about the false event, participants were asked to
               fabricate a memory report. Results indicated that 26\% of
               participants ``recovered'' a complete memory for the false
               experience and another 30\% recalled aspects of the false
               experience. Real, implanted, and fabricated memories differed on
               several dimensions (e.g., confidence, vividness, details,

               distinguishing between dreams and reality may lead to false
               memories. The present article discusses two studies (N = 85 and
               255, respectively) that examined to what extent such
               difficulties occur. In both studies, a nontrivial minority of
               respondents (11.8\% and 25.9\%, respectively) reported that they

               evaluators' abilities to discriminate between accurate and

               Each then gave videotaped testimony about their identification,

               believe the testimony of mistaken eyewitnesses, indicating

               abstract concepts. In particular, it argues that the initial
               state includes several systems of core cognition with long
               evolutionary histories. Core cognition includes abstract
               concepts with conceptual content. Second, nonetheless, there are
               discontinuities in conceptual development at two different
               levels of generality. At a general level, most human concepts
               differ from those embedded in core cognition in many ways, and,
               at a specific level, core cognition does not have the resources
               to represent most specific abstract concepts. Third, it
               characterizes one class of learning mechanism that underlies the
               discontinuities of interest: Quinian bootstrapping. With this
               analysis in hand, the chapter speculates on some aspects of
               conceptual representations unique to humans. These points are

               concepts, which had meaningful features interconnected by common

               function of feature meaningfulness. Experiment 2 suggested that

  abstract  = "When people are asked to decide whether an object is in a given
               category, they generally respond faster when the category is at
               the basic level (e.g., car) than when it is at the superordinate
               level (e.g., vehicle) or the subordinate level (e.g., sedan).
               Basic categories have shorter and more frequent names, are
               learned earlier, and are usually more highly differentiated than
               other categories (they are both specific and distinctive), but
               it is not clear which of these factors is responsible for the
               faster response to basic categories. In three experiments with
               natural language categories, we found evidence that objects can
               be identified fastest as members of differentiated categories,
               even when such categories have longer names and are learned
               later than less differentiated categories. Specifically, we
               argued that atypical subordinate categories (e.g., racing car)
               are highly differentiated and should therefore be responded to
               as fast as basic categories in object recognition. The results
               supported this view and also ruled out the hypothesis that
               objects are necessarily identified as members of basic
               categories before further identification. We discuss the

               impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In

               direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity
               can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization.
               This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a
               cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes
               decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive
               linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal
               characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the
               diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages.
               After surveying the various uses of ``universal,'' we illustrate
               the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and
               syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the
               core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and
               grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent
               patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable

               METHODS: Participants were randomized to PA (n = 19) or
               sedentary attention control (n = 16) programs. Academic records,
               curriculum-based measures, and classroom observations were

               variance or Kruskal-Wallis tested for differences in
               postintervention classroom observations. RESULTS:
               Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated a moderate effect within
               groups from baseline to postintervention on disciplinary
               referrals (PA: d = -0.47; attention control: d = -0.36) and a
               null moderate effect on academic assessments (PA: d = 0.11 to
               0.36; attention control: d = 0.05 to 0.40). No significant group
               $\times$ time interactions emerged on direct academic
               assessments (all Ps $\geq$ .05, d = -0.23 to 0.26) or academic
               records (all Ps $\geq$ .05, d = -0.28 to 0.16). Classroom
               observations revealed that intervention participants were
               off-task due to moving at twice the rate of comparative
               classmates (F = 15.74, P < .001) and were off-task due to
               talking 33\% more often (F = 1.39, P = .257). CONCLUSION:
               Academic outcome improvements were small within and between
               groups and did not sustain at follow-up. Academic benefits of
               after-school PA programs for children with attention-deficit

  abstract  = "Deaf children whose access to usable conventional linguistic
               input, signed or spoken, is severely limited nevertheless use
               gesture to communicate. These gestures resemble natural language
               in that they are structured at the level both of sentence and of
               word. Although the inclination to use gesture may be traceable
               to the fact that the deaf children's hearing parents, like all
               speakers, gesture as they talk, the children themselves are
               responsible for introducing language-like structure into their
               gestures. We have explored the robustness of this phenomenon by
               observing deaf children of hearing parents in two cultures, an
               American and a Chinese culture, that differ in their
               child-rearing practices and in the way gesture is used in
               relation to speech. The spontaneous sign systems developed in
               these cultures shared a number of structural similarities:
               patterned production and deletion of semantic elements in the
               surface structure of a sentence; patterned ordering of those
               elements within the sentence; and concatenation of propositions
               within a sentence. These striking similarities offer critical
               empirical input towards resolving the ongoing debate about the
               'innateness' of language in human infants.",

               from 2.3 million immigrants with Spanish or Chinese language
               backgrounds. The analyses tested a key prediction of the

               attainment on age of immigration would be markedly different on
               either side of the critical-age point. Predictions tested were
               that there would be a difference in slope, a difference in the
               mean while controlling for slope, or both. The results showed
               large linear effects for level of education and for age of
               immigration, but a negligible amount of additional variance was
               accounted for when the parameters for difference in slope and

  abstract  = "Lenneberg (1967) hypothesized that language could be acquired
               only within a critical period, extending from early infancy
               until puberty. In its basic form, the critical period hypothesis
               need only have consequences for first language acquisition.
               Nevertheless, it is essential to our understanding of the nature
               of the hypothesized critical period to determine whether or not
               it extends as well to second language acquisition. If so, it
               should be the case that young children are better second
               language learners than adults and should consequently reach
               higher levels of final proficiency in the second language. This
               prediction was tested by comparing the English proficiency
               attained by 46 native Korean or Chinese speakers who had arrived
               in the United States between the ages of 3 and 39, and who had
               lived in the United States between 3 and 26 years by the time of
               testing. These subjects were tested on a wide variety of
               structures of English grammar, using a grammaticality judgment
               task. Both correlational and t-test analyses demonstrated a
               clear and strong advantage for earlier arrivals over the later
               arrivals. Test performance was linearly related to age of
               arrival up to puberty; after puberty, performance was low but
               highly variable and unrelated to age of arrival. This age effect
               was shown not to be an inadvertent result of differences in
               amount of experience with English, motivation,
               self-consciousness, or American identification. The effect also
               appeared on every grammatical structure tested, although the
               structures varied markedly in the degree to which they were well
               mastered by later learners. The results support the conclusion
               that a critical period for language acquisition extends its

               are predisposed to interpret nouns as referring to taxonomic

               conceptual hierarchies (e.g., collie, dog, mammal, animal. Two
               familiar hierarchies---animals and food---and two linguistic
               form classes---nouns and adjectives---were examined in detail.
               Experiment 1 tested the effect of introducing novel nouns at
               multiple hierarchical levels (subordinate, basic, intermediate,
               and superordinate). Some children were introduced to novel nouns
               for the classes (e.g., suikahs); others heard no labels. Nouns
               facilitated superordinate level classification, but made
               subordinate classification more difficult. In Experiment 2,
               another group of children labeled the classes to enable a direct
               comparison of preschoolers' linguistic descriptions and
               conceptual groupings. They tended to label all subordinate
               classes identically (e.g., they labeled all subclasses of dogs
               as `dogs'), yet when they were explicitly instructed to
               distinguish them, they used adjectival phrases (e.g., `big
               dogs'). In Experiment 3, novel labels were presented in two
               different linguistic contexts, either as nouns (e.g., suikahs)
               or as adjectives (e.g., suk-ish ones). As in Experiment 1, nouns
               made subordinate classification more difficult. Conversely,
               adjectival phrases facilitated subordinate classification, but
               made superordinate classification more difficult. Children's
               early sensitivity to the different applications of nouns and

               infants can discriminate non-native speech contrasts without
               relevant experience, and that there is a decline in this ability
               during ontogeny. Furthermore, data from both cross-sectional and
               longitudinal studies shows that this decline occurs within the
               first year of life, and that it is a function of specific

               Groot's (1965) short-term recall task, where the player
               reproduces a chess position after viewing it for 5 sec. The
               successive glances at the position in the perceptual task and
               long pauses in the memory task were used to segment the
               structures in the reconstruction protocol. The size and nature

               guide the problemsolving process was investigated. The
               representation of analogy in memory and processes involved in
               the use of analogies were discussed theoretically and explored
               in five experiments. In Experiment I oral protocols were used to
               examine the processes involved in solving a problem by analogy.
               In all experiments subjects who first read a story about a
               military problem and its solution tended to generate analogous
               solutions to a medical problem (Duncker's ``radiation
               problem''), provided they were given a hint to use the story to
               help solve the problem. Transfer frequency was reduced when the
               problem presented in the military story was substantially
               disanalogous to the radiation problem, even though the solution
               illustrated in the story corresponded to an effective radiation
               solution (Experiment II). Subjects in Experiment III tended to
               generate analogous solutions to the radiation problem after
               providing their own solutions to the military problem. Subjects
               were able to retrieve the story from memory and use it to
               generate an analogous solution, even when the critical story had
               been memorized in the context of two distractor stories
               (Experiment IV). However, when no hint to consider the story was
               given, frequency of analogous solutions decreased markedly. This
               decrease in transfer occurred when the story analogy was
               presented in a recall task along with distractor stories
               (Experiment IV), when it was presented alone, and when it was
               presented in between two attempts to solve the problem
               (Experiment V). Component processes and strategic variations in
               analogical problem solving were discussed. Issues related to
               noticing analogies and accessing them in memory were also
               examined, as was the relationship of analogical reasoning to
               other cognitive tasks.",

  abstract  = "An analysis of the process of analogical thinking predicts that
               analogies will be noticed on the basis of semantic retrieval
               cues and that the induction of a general schema from concrete
               analogs will facilitate analogical transfer. These predictions
               were tested in experiments in which subjects first read one or
               more stories illustrating problems and their solutions and then
               attempted to solve a disparate but analogous transfer problem.
               The studies in Part I attempted to foster the abstraction of a
               problem schema from a single story analog by means of
               summarization instructions, a verbal statement of the underlying
               principle, or a diagrammatic representation of it. None of these
               devices achieved a notable degree of sucess. In contrast, the
               experiments in Part II demonstrated that if two prior analogs
               were given, subjects often derived a problem schema as an
               incidental product of describing the similarities of the
               analogs. The quality of the induced schema was highly predictive
               of subsequent transfer performance. Furthermore, the verbal
               statements and diagrams that had failed to facilitate transfer
               from one analog proved highly beneficial when paired with two.

  abstract = {The evolution of cognitive psychology, traced from the beginnings of a rigorous experimental psychology at the end of the nineteenth century to the "cognitive revolution" at the end of the twentieth, and the social and cultural contexts of its theoretical developments.             Modern psychology began with the adoption of experimental methods at the end of the nineteenth century: Wilhelm Wundt established the first formal laboratory in 1879; universities created independent chairs in psychology shortly thereafter; and William James published the landmark work Principles of Psychology in 1890. In A History of Modern Experimental Psychology, George Mandler traces the evolution of modern experimental and theoretical psychology from these beginnings to the "cognitive revolution" of the late twentieth century. Throughout, he emphasizes the social and cultural context, showing how different theoretical developments reflect the characteristics and values of the society in which they occurred. Thus, Gestalt psychology can be seen to mirror the changes in visual and intellectual culture at the turn of the century, behaviorism to embody the parochial and puritanical concerns of early twentieth-century America, and contemporary cognitive psychology as a product of the postwar revolution in information and communication.             After discussing the meaning and history of the concept of mind, Mandler treats the history of the psychology of thought and memory from the late nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth, exploring, among other topics, the discovery of the unconscious, the destruction of psychology in Germany in the 1930s, and the relocation of the field's "center of gravity" to the United States. He then examines a more neglected part of the history of psychology---the emergence of a new and robust cognitive psychology under the umbrella of cognitive science.
